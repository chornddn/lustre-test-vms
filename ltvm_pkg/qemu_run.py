        returns EPERM (OSError), which previously made `ltvm list`

    comm alone only rules out reuse by a *non-QEMU* process, which is

    low and so do the stale PIDs left in .info files, so VM A's stale
    pid can land on VM B's live QEMU.  `ltvm list` then shows A
    running, `ltvm start A` says "already running" and never boots it,

    B's QEMU while tearing down A's artifacts.  QEMU is launched with
    ``-name <vm.name>``, so the command line carries the identity;
