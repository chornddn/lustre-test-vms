# Getting Started with ltvm

This guide walks through common workflows, from the simplest
path to more advanced setups.

Already set up and just want the day-to-day loop? It is one
section: [One Way to Build, Deploy, Mount and
Test](../CLAUDE.md#one-way-to-build-deploy-mount-and-test).
This guide is for getting there the first time.

## Prerequisites

- Linux host (WSL2 works)
- podman installed
- Python 3.10+ -- EL8/EL9 ship an older `python3`, so there:
  `dnf install -y python3.11 python3.11-pyyaml`, then run ltvm
  as `python3.11 ./ltvm <args>` until it is installed
- Root access (for VM lifecycle)

Run the one-time host setup:

```bash
sudo ltvm install
```

This installs QEMU (with microvm support), configures the
network bridge + dnsmasq, sets up SSH keys, and puts `ltvm`
on your PATH.

It also sets the host up so VMs need no sudo: it creates an
`ltvm` group, adds you to it (and to `kvm`), and makes QEMU's
bridge helper usable by that group.  **Log in again** for the
group to take effect.  Add other users the same way:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG ltvm,kvm <user>
```

`ltvm doctor` reports whether VMs can run without sudo for you,
and what is missing if not.  Where the distro ships no
`qemu-bridge-helper`, VMs keep working through sudo.

The bridge wants `192.168.100.0/24`. If something on the
machine already uses that range, install moves to the next free
`192.168.x` and says so, rather than taking the host's own
network out from under it. Name a range yourself with
`--subnet 192.168.200`; an explicit one is obeyed, or refused if
it is occupied.

It also installs tab completion for bash, zsh and fish --
whichever of them the host has. **Open a new shell** to pick
it up, then TAB completes targets, VMs, clusters, kernels and
variants from your actual state:

```bash
ltvm build kernel roc<TAB>        # rocky8 rocky9 rocky9-64k rocky10
ltvm deploy-lustre co<TAB>        # your VMs
```

If nothing completes, `ltvm doctor` reports it and `ltvm
doctor --fix` installs it. To keep it in your own dotfiles
instead, add `eval "$(ltvm completion)"` to `~/.bashrc`.

## Simple Flow: Pre-built Artifacts

The fastest path -- download pre-built kernel + image from
GitHub, optionally build Lustre from source, and run a VM.

### 1. Fetch pre-built artifacts

```bash
ltvm target fetch rocky9
```

This downloads a tarball containing the kernel (vmlinux,
vmlinuz, build-tree, modules) and VM base image (base.ext4)
into `artifacts/rocky9/x86_64/`.

Check what you have:

```bash
ltvm build status
```

### 2. Create a VM

```bash
sudo ltvm create co1-single \
    --vcpus 2 --mem 4096 \
    --mdt-disks 1 --ost-disks 3
```

The VM boots in ~2 seconds. It uses the pre-built kernel
(passed to QEMU via `-kernel`) and a copy-on-write overlay
of the base image.

### 3. Deploy and mount Lustre

If the fetched artifacts include a pre-built Lustre snapshot,
you can deploy directly:

```bash
ltvm deploy co1-single
ltvm llmount co1-single
```

### 4. Build and deploy your own Lustre (optional)

To test your own Lustre changes, build from source and deploy:

```bash
ltvm build lustre rocky9 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release
ltvm deploy co1-single --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release
ltvm llmount co1-single
```

`build-lustre` runs inside the build container against the
pre-built kernel's build-tree. Incremental builds are fast --
only changed files recompile.

### 5. Run a test

```bash
ltvm test co1 sanity --only 42a
```

`ltvm test` runs auster on the cluster's client node and
parses auster's own `results.yml`, so you get a result object
instead of console output to scrape. `--only` / `--except` are
the only spelling that works: `run_suites()` in
`test-framework.sh` unsets `ONLY` and `EXCEPT`, so the
environment form is silently discarded and the tests run
anyway.

### 6. Iterate

Edit Lustre source, then:

```bash
ltvm build lustre rocky9 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release
ltvm deploy co1-single
ltvm llmount co1-single
```

The build is incremental (make sees previous .o files).
Deploy is idempotent (cleans existing state, rsyncs, remounts).


## Intermediate Flow: Build Everything from Scratch

When you need to build the kernel and image yourself -- for
example, when working on kernel patches or testing a new OS
version.

### 1. Build the build container

```bash
ltvm build container rocky9
```

Creates a podman image (`ltvm-build-rocky9`) with GCC,
autotools, kernel build deps, and Lustre build deps. This
is the environment used for all subsequent builds.

### 2. Build the kernel

```bash
ltvm build kernel rocky9 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release
```

The Lustre tree is needed because it contains the kernel
patches, patch series, base config, and SRPM version info
(in `lustre/kernel_patches/`). The SRPM is downloaded from
the Rocky mirror and cached in `artifacts/rocky9/x86_64/cache/`.

Output: `artifacts/rocky9/x86_64/kernels/<name>/` with vmlinux,
vmlinuz, modules, and a full build-tree for Lustre module
compilation.

### 3. Build the VM base image

```bash
ltvm build image rocky9
```

Builds a container image with all packages, exports it
to a raw ext4 filesystem via `mke2fs -d` under fakeroot
(no loop-mount, no root).  Takes ~10 minutes.

### 4. Build Lustre

```bash
ltvm build lustre rocky9 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release
```

### 5. Create VM, deploy, test

```bash
sudo ltvm create co1-single \
    --vcpus 2 --mem 4096 \
    --mdt-disks 1 --ost-disks 3
ltvm deploy co1-single --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release
ltvm llmount co1-single
```

### Shortcut: build-all

Steps 1-3 can be combined:

```bash
ltvm build all rocky9 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release
```


## Advanced Flow: Multiple Kernels

A single target supports multiple kernel versions. Rocky 9
ships with two:

```yaml
# targets/targets.yaml
rocky9:
  kernels:
    default: 5.14-rhel9.7
    available:
      - 5.14-rhel9.7
      - 5.14-rhel9.5
```

Build a non-default kernel:

```bash
ltvm build kernel rocky9 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release \
    --kernel 5.14-rhel9.5
```

Build Lustre against it:

```bash
ltvm build lustre rocky9 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release --kernel 5.14-rhel9.5
```

Deploy with it:

```bash
ltvm deploy co1-single --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release
ltvm llmount co1-single
```

`deploy` has no `--kernel`: it reads the target, kernel, arch
and variant from the node's own metadata, so it cannot
contradict what the node runs. `--kernel` belongs to
`build lustre`, which is where the choice is actually made.
`deploy` never mounts either -- `llmount` is the mount command.

Each kernel gets its own directory under
`artifacts/rocky9/x86_64/kernels/`, so they coexist without conflict.


## Advanced Flow: Multi-Node Clusters

For testing distributed Lustre (separate MDS, OSS, client):

```bash
# Create a cluster with named roles
ltvm cluster create co2 \
    mgs+mds:co2-mds:1 \
    oss:co2-oss:3

# Build for the cluster's own target/kernel/arch, then deploy and mount
ltvm build lustre --for-cluster co2 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release
ltvm deploy co2 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-release
ltvm cluster llmount co2

# Run a command on all OSS nodes
ltvm cluster exec co2 oss 'lctl dl'

# Unmount, stop, and bring it back later
ltvm cluster llumount co2
ltvm cluster stop co2
ltvm cluster start co2
ltvm cluster llmount co2

# Tear down
ltvm cluster destroy co2
```

`cluster create` and `cluster destroy` need `sudo` in front when this
host cannot run VMs unprivileged; `ltvm doctor` says which applies.

VM names must include the checkout number: `co<N>-<role>`.


## Advanced Flow: Interactive Container Shell

For debugging build issues:

```bash
ltvm build shell rocky9
```

Opens a shell inside the build container with the Lustre
source tree bind-mounted. You can run configure, make,
inspect the toolchain, etc.


## Key Concepts

### Artifacts and Staleness

Each artifact (container, kernel, image) stores an input hash
in `meta.json`. When you run a build command, ltvm hashes the
current inputs (Dockerfiles, package lists, kernel config) and
compares. If unchanged, the build is skipped.

```bash
ltvm build status          # shows current/stale for each artifact
```

### Incremental Lustre Builds

The Lustre source tree is bind-mounted into the container, so
.o files persist between builds. Configure is only re-run when
the kernel version, kernel path, or server flag changes. A
libtool version check prevents stale autotools state.

### VM Lifecycle

VMs are disposable. The base image is shared (read-only);
each VM gets a copy-on-write qcow2 overlay.

Recreating a VM is not the way to clear Lustre state, though.
`ltvm llmount <vm> --cleanup` leaves the node with nothing
resident, or exits non-zero naming what is still held. On a
cluster somebody else may be using, destroy is not yours to
run: ask the operator, and note that a destroyed VM takes its
console log and any vmcore with it.

### Deploy is Idempotent

`ltvm deploy` always:
1. Clears any Lustre left running, and fails if it cannot
2. Rsyncs the staging tree
3. Writes `cfg/local.sh` and `/etc/modprobe.d/lnet.conf`
   together, from one resolved LNet net

It does not mount. `ltvm llmount` does that, as its own step.

### One Staging Dir Per Tree

`ltvm build lustre` installs to
`<lustre-tree>/.ltvm-staging/<target>/<arch>/<kernel>[/<variant>]/`.

Staging is keyed by source tree, so two trees do not collide
and two people on one host do not overwrite each other:

```bash
ltvm build lustre rocky9 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-v1    # staging under lustre-v1
ltvm build lustre rocky9 --lustre-tree ~/lustre-v2    # staging under lustre-v2
```

`deploy` takes the same `--lustre-tree`, so it picks up the
staging belonging to the tree you built.

In practice: build, deploy, mount, test, iterate -- see
[the canonical flow](../CLAUDE.md#one-way-to-build-deploy-mount-and-test).
